Welcome to Oracle Coherence Hibernate Project
=============================================

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ghillert/coherence-hibernate/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ghillert/coherence-hibernate/actions)

The Oracle Coherence Hibernate project implements integration points between Oracle Coherence and the Hibernate
object/relational mapping framework from JBoss.org.  

Two primary integration points are covered currently: using Coherence as a second-level cache in
Hibernate; and using Hibernate as a Coherence CacheStore implementation.

Detailed project documentation for the latest release (1.0.0) is available
here: [http://coherence-community.github.io/coherence-hibernate/1.0.0/](http://coherence-community.github.io/coherence-hibernate/1.0.0/)

> **NOTE**
>
> The [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org)-based snapshots and releases for this project are published to Maven Central.
