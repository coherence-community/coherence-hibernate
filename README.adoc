The Oracle Coherence Hibernate project implements integration points between Oracle Coherence/link:https://coherence.community[Coherence CE]
and the https://hibernate.org/orm/[Hibernate Object/Relational Mapping (ORM)] framework.

Two primary integration points are covered currently:

* using Coherence as a {hibernate-docs}#caching[second-level cache] in Hibernate
* using Hibernate as a Coherence CacheStore implementation

Due to Hibernate Cache API changes, Coherence Hibernate `{snapshot-version}` provides dedicated Maven modules targeting those Hibernate versions:

* `coherence-hibernate-cache-4` supports Hibernate `4.3.x`
* `coherence-hibernate-cache-5` supports Hibernate `5.0.x` and `5.1.x`
* `coherence-hibernate-cache-52` supports Hibernate `5.2.x`
* `coherence-hibernate-cache-53` supports Hibernate `5.3.x`, `5.4.x`,`5.5.x` and `5.6.x`

== Documentation

Detailed project documentation is available on the {website}[Coherence Hibernate website]. This includes the reference documentation

The reference documentation will also refer to various demo and sample applications. Those are part of this
repository, and you can find those in the https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-hibernate/tree/main/samples[samples] module.

== Building from Source

=== Requirements

In order to build Coherence Hibernate, you need to have installed:

- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[JDK 11]
- https://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect[Git]

NOTE: When using Coherence Hibernate merely as a dependency in a project, without intending to build the project from
source code, then an installed _JDK 8_ version is sufficient.

=== Check out sources

Check out the project using https://git-scm.com/[Git]:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
git clone https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-hibernate.git
cd coherence-hibernate
----

Coherence Hibernate uses https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] as build tool. You do not need to have Maven installed to
build the project. Simply use the provided https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[Maven Wrapper], e.g.:

- *Windows:* `mvnw.cmd clean package`
- *Linux/Mac:* `./mvnw clean package`

=== Build the entire project

Build the entire project using https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

==== Offline Builds

In case you are offline, and you run into issues building the project, e.g.
the Coherence cluster as part of JUnit tests does not start up successfully, then
you may have to provide additional command line arguments:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package -DargLine="-Dcoherence.localhost=127.0.0.1 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
----

=== Build the project website

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install -pl coherence-hibernate-site
----

=== Deploy the project website

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw deploy -pl coherence-hibernate-site
----
