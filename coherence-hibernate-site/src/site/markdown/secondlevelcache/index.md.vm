Coherence Hibernate Second-Level Cache
======================================

This page describes how you can use Oracle Coherence as a second-level cache in Hibernate, an object-relational
mapping library for Java applications.  Since version 2.1 (released December 11th 2003) Hibernate has incorporated
second-level caching, by allowing an implementation of a Service Provider Interface (SPI) to be configured.  In
Hibernate version 3.3 (released September 11th 2008) the second-level cache SPI was significantly redesigned.
The Coherence Hibernate second-level cache described in this document implements the redesigned SPI used in Hibernate
version 3.3 and later.

Using Coherence as a Hibernate second-level cache implementation allows multiple JVMs running the same Hibernate
application to share a second-level cache.  The use of Coherence caches in this scenario is completely controlled by
Hibernate.  You should have a good understanding of Hibernate second-level caching to successfully use the Coherence
Hibernate second-level cache implementation.  For more information on Hibernate second-level caching, see the
"Improving Performance" chapter of the Hibernate Core Reference Manual at <http://www.hibernate.org/docs>.

Using Coherence as a Hibernate second-level cache implementation may be a good fit for Java applications that use
Hibernate for data access and management, and that run in a cluster of application servers accessing the same database.


<h3>Installing the Coherence Hibernate Second-Level Cache</h3>

Installing the Coherence Hibernate second-level cache implementation amounts to obtaining a distribution of
`coherence-hibernate-second-level-cache-${project.version}.jar` and making it available to JVM ClassLoaders.  The easiest way to do
so is to build and execute your Hibernate application with Maven, and add the following dependency to your application’s
`pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.hibernate</groupId>
        <artifactId>coherence-hibernate-second-level-cache</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Alternatively, you can download `coherence-hibernate-second-level-cache-${project.version}.jar` from a Maven repository (e.g.
<https://maven.java.net>) and use it in JVM classpaths.  Or you can [build](building.html) the Coherence Hibernate
second-level cache implementation from sources.

Note that the Coherence Hibernate second-level cache implementation depends at runtime on an installation of Oracle
Coherence, and an installation of Hibernate.  These dependencies are most easily managed using Maven.  You can install
Coherence artifacts into your Maven repository as documented here:
<http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/coherence/COHDG/gs_install.htm#A7113537>.


<h3>Configuring Hibernate Second-Level and Query Caching</h3>

Hibernate uses three forms of caching: the session cache, the second-level cache, and the query cache.

The session cache caches entities within a Hibernate Session. A Hibernate Session is a transaction-level cache of
persistent data, potentially spanning multiple database transactions, and typically scoped on a per-thread basis.  As a
non-clustered cache, the session cache is managed entirely by Hibernate.

The second-level and query caches span multiple transactions, and support the use of Coherence as a cache provider. The
second-level cache is responsible for caching records across multiple Sessions (for primary key lookups). The query
cache caches the result sets generated by Hibernate queries. Hibernate manages data in an internal representation in the
second-level and query caches, meaning that these caches are usable only by Hibernate. For more information, see the
"Improving Performance" chapter of the Hibernate Core Reference Manual at <http://www.hibernate.org/docs>.

To configure Coherence as the Hibernate second-level cache, set the `hibernate.cache.region.factory_class` property in
Hibernate configuration to `com.oracle.coherence.hibernate.cache.CoherenceRegionFactory`.  For example, include the
following property setting in `hibernate.cfg.xml`:

    <property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">
        com.oracle.coherence.hibernate.cache.CoherenceRegionFactory
    </property>

In addition to setting the `hibernate.cache.region.factory_class` property, you must also configure Hibernate to use
second-level caching, and query caching if desired, by setting the appropriate Hibernate configuration properties to
true, as follows:

    <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property>
    <property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache">true</property>

Furthermore, you must configure each entity class mapped by Hibernate, and each Collection-typed field mapped by
Hibernate, to use caching on a case-by-case basis.  To configure mapped classes and Collection-typed fields to use
second-level caching, add <cache> elements to the class’s mapping file as in the following example, or use the
equivalent Hibernate annotations.

    <hibernate-mapping package="org.hibernate.tutorial.domain">
        <class name="Person" table="PERSON">
            <cache usage="read-write" />
            <id name="id" column="PERSON_ID">
                <generator class="native"/>
            </id>
            <property name="age"/>
            <property name="firstname"/>
            <property name="lastname"/>
            <set name="events" table="PERSON_EVENT">
                <cache usage="read-write" />
                <key column="PERSON_ID"/>
                <many-to-many column="EVENT_ID" class="Event"/>
            </set>
            <set name="emailAddresses" table="PERSON_EMAIL_ADDR">
                <cache usage="read-write" />
                <key column="PERSON_ID"/>
                <element type="string" column="EMAIL_ADDR"/>
            </set>
        </class>
    </hibernate-mapping>

The possible values for the usage attribute of the cache element are as follows:

    <cache usage="transactional | read-write | nonstrict-read-write | read-only">

The meaning and effect of each possible value is documented below in the section on cache concurrency strategies.

To configure query caching, you must furthermore call `setCacheable()`, passing `true`, on each `org.hibernate.Query`
executed by your application code, as in the following example:

    public List listPersons() {
        Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
        session.beginTransaction();
        Query query = session.createQuery("from Person");
        query.setCacheable(true);
        List result = query.list();
        session.getTransaction().commit();
        return result;
    }

Finally, Hibernate provides the configuration property `hibernate.cache.use_minimal_puts`, which optimizes cache
management for clustered caches by minimizing cache update operations.  The Coherence caching provider enables this by
default.  Setting this property to false might increase overhead for cache management.

<h3>Types of Hibernate Second-Level Cache</h3>

Hibernate’s second-level cache design utilizes five different types of second-level cache, as reflected in the names of
sub-interfaces of `org.hibernate.cache.spi.Region`:

* `EntityRegions` cache the data of entity instances mapped by Hibernate.  By default Hibernate uses the fully-qualified
name of the entity class as the name of an `EntityRegion` cache; though the name can be overridden through configuration.
* `CollectionRegions` cache the data of Collection-typed fields of mapped entities.  Hibernate names `CollectionRegion`
caches using the fully-qualified name of the entity class followed by the name of the Collection-typed field, separated
by a period.
* `NaturalIdRegions` cache mappings of secondary identifiers to primary identifiers for entities.
* `QueryResultsRegions` cache the result sets of queries executed by Hibernate.  Cache keys are formed using the query
string and parameters, and cache values are collections of identifiers of entities satisfying the query.  By default
Hibernate uses one `QueryResultsRegion` with the name "`org.hibernate.cache.internal.StandardQueryCache`".  Hibernate
users can instantiate `QueryResultsRegions` by calling `org.hibernate.Query.setCacheRegion()` passing custom cache names
(by convention these names should begin with `query.`).
* `TimestampsRegions` cache timestamps at which database tables were last written by Hibernate.  These timestamps are
used by Hibernate during query processing to determine whether cached query results can be used (if a query involves a
certain table, and that table was written more recently than when the result set for that query was last cached, then
the cached result set may be stale and cannot be used).  Hibernate uses one `TimestampsRegion` named
“`org.hibernate.cache.spi.UpdateTimestampsCache`”.  The keys in this cache are database table names, and the values are
machine clock readings.

`EntityRegions`, `CollectionRegions`, and `NaturalIdRegions` are treated by Hibernate as “transactional” cache regions,
meaning that the full variety of cache concurrency strategies may be configured (see the next section).  Whereas
`QueryResultsRegions` and `TimestampsRegions` are used by Hibernate as “general data” regions, rendering cache
concurrency strategies irrelevant for those types of caches.

<h3>Cache Concurrency Strategies</h3>

The Hibernate cache architecture defines four different "cache concurrency strategies" in association with its
second-level cache. These are intended to allow Hibernate users to configure the degree of database consistency and
transaction isolation desired for second-level cache contents, for data concurrently read and written through Hibernate.
The following table describes the four Hibernate second-level cache concurrency strategies.

<table border='1' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='20'>
  <tr>
    <th align='left' width='15%'>Strategy</th>
    <th align='left' width='45%'>Intent</th>
    <th align='left' width='40%'>Write Transaction Sequence</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign='top'>transactional</td>
    <td valign='top'>Guarantee cache consistency with database, and repeatable read isolation, via JTA transactions enlisting both as resources.</td>
    <td valign='top'>Cache and database committed atomically in same JTA transaction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign='top'>read/write</td>
    <td valign='top'>Maintain strong consistency with database, and read committed isolation in second-level cache.</td>
    <td valign='top'>Database committed first, then cache updated using locking model.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign='top'>nonstrict read/write</td>
    <td valign='top'>Better performance, but no guarantee of consistency with database or read committed isolation in second-level cache.</td>
    <td valign='top'>Database committed first, then cache invalidated to cause subsequent read-through.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign='top'>read only</td>
    <td valign='top'>Best performance for read-only data.</td>
    <td valign='top'>Not applicable.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

For `EntityRegions`, `CollectionRegions`, and `NaturalIdRegions`, the appropriate cache concurrency strategy can be
configured via the usage attribute of the cache element in the Hibernate mapping file for a mapped entity class, or via
equivalent annotation.

The Coherence Hibernate second-level cache implementation does not support the transactional cache concurrency strategy.


<h3>Configuring Coherence Caches for Hibernate Second-Level Caching</h3>

By default, the Coherence Hibernate second-level cache implementation uses a cache configuration file named
`hibernate-second-level-cache-config.xml` at the root level in `coherence-hibernate-second-level-cache-${project.version}.jar`.
This configuration file defines cache mappings for Hibernate second-level caches.  You can specify an alternative cache
configuration file for Hibernate second-level caches using the Hibernate or Java property
`com.oracle.coherence.hibernate.cache.cache_config_file_path`, whose value should be the path to a file or ClassLoader
resource, or a `file://` URL.

In fact it is recommended and expected that you specify an alternative cache configuration file customized for the
domain model and consistency / isolation requirements of your particular Hibernate application.  For each mapped entity
class and Collection-typed field, it is recommended that you configure an explicit cache mapping to the scheme (with
expiry and size parameters) appropriate for that cache given application requirements.  See comments in the default
cache configuration file for more detail on customizing cache configuration for your application - the default cache
configuration file takes a conservative approach, and it is likely that you can optimize cache access latency and hit
ratio (via size) for entity and Collection caches with relaxed consistency / isolation requirements.

In any case, it is recommended that you configure dedicated cache services for Hibernate second-level caches (as is done
in the default cache configuration file), to avoid the potential for reentrant calls into cache services when
Hibernate-based `CacheStores` are used.  Furthermore, second-level caches should be size-limited in all tiers to avoid
the possibility of heap exhaustion.  Query caches in particular should be size-limited because the Hibernate API does
not provide any means of controlling the query cache other than a complete eviction.  Finally, expiration should be
considered if the underlying database can be written by clients other than the Hibernate application.


<h3>Configuring Clients and Servers for Hibernate Second-Level Caching</h3>

Both the clients of the Coherence Hibernate second-level caches – e.g. application server JVMs running Hibernate-based
applications – and the Coherence cache server JVMs actually holding the cache contents  - need to have a common set of
jar file artifacts available to their ClassLoaders.  Specifically, both need
`coherence-hibernate-second-level-cache-${project.version}.jar` and its dependencies Coherence and Hibernate (and their dependencies).

The Coherence cache server JVMs need the Hibernate core jar file to deserialize `CacheEntry` classes
(`org.hibernate.cache.spi.entry.*`) since the Coherence Hibernate second-level cache implementation uses Coherence
`EntryProcessors` to optimize concurrency control.  However the cache server JVMs do not need the Hibernate
application’s jar files containing entity classes etc.

The client / application server JVMs do of course need the Hibernate application’s jar files containing entity classes
etc.  And they should be configured to be “storage-disabled”, i.e. to not store contents of distributed caches.  See
comments in the default hibernate-second-level-cache-config.xml for details on how to accomplish that configuration – it
amounts to starting clients and servers with slightly different cache configuration files, or passing
`–Dtangosol.coherence.distributed.localstorage=false` to client JVMs.

Both client and server JVMs will need the same Coherence operational configuration (see
<http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/coherence/COHDG/gs_config.htm#COHDG5002>) specifying necessary cluster
communication parameters.  Coherence provides default operational configuration, but it is a best practice to override
communication parameters and cluster name to make them unique for each separate application environment.
